# yahoo-sample-data

Sample html data for testing Yahoo stock scraper. Files have been edited to only contain the data structure needed to find stock info for scraping. Times and dates are also sanitized as they aren't necessary for my testing.

The intent for this repository is to reduce web requests directly to Yahoo during internal testing of scraping module changes and also avoid muddying up my own repositories that are pure python.

All rights belong to Yahoo.
